          An allotment (British English) or community garden (North America)
          is a plot of land made available for individual, non-commercial
          gardening or growing food plants, so forming a kitchen garden away
          from the residence of the user. Such plots are formed by subdividing a
          piece of land into a few or up to several hundred parcels that are
          assigned to individuals or families. Such parcels are cultivated
          individually, contrary to other community garden types
          where the entire area is tended collectively by a group of people.
          <br /><br />In countries that do not use the term "allotment
          (garden)", a "community garden" may refer to individual small garden
          plots as well as to a single, large piece of land gardened
          collectively by a group of people. The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_garden">"victory garden"</a> is also
          still sometimes used, especially when a community garden dates back to
          the First or Second World War.

        <h2>
          The individual size of a parcel typically suits the needs of a family,
          and often the plots include a shed for tools and shelter, and
          sometimes a hut for seasonal or weekend accommodation. The individual
          gardeners are usually organised in an allotment association, which
          leases or is granted the land from an owner who may be a public,
          private or ecclesiastical entity, and who usually stipulates that it
          be only used for gardening (i.e., growing <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/beginners-guide/allotment-basics/choose-your-crops"> vegetables, fruits and
          flowers</a>), but not for permanent residential purposes (this is usually
          also required by zoning laws). <br /><br />The gardeners have to pay a
          small membership fee to the association and have to abide by the
          corresponding constitution and by-laws. However, the membership
          entitles them to certain democratic rights.

          The Luxembourg-based <a href="http://www.jardins-familiaux.org/"><i>Office International du Coin de Terre et des
            Jardins Familiaux</i></a>, representing three million European allotment
          gardeners since 1926, describes the socio-cultural and economic
          functions of allotment gardens as offering an improved quality of
          life, an enjoyable and profitable hobby, relaxation, and contact with
          nature. <br /><br />For children, gardens offer places to play and to
          learn about nature, while for the unemployed, they offer a feeling of
          doing something useful as well as low-cost food. For the elderly and
          disabled, gardens offer an opportunity to meet people, to share in
          activity with like-minded people, and to experience activities like
          planting and harvesting.
